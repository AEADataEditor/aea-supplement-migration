1. agent, as specified in the specs is just one person and not a seq of persons. agent requires an email Id(foaf:mbox) for the person. 
3. In other terms agent is the owner and creator(s) are the primary investigator(s). The agent can be a creator but not all creators are agent. One agent per project/study and multiple creators can exist, for the study.
2. person has required fields : First Name, Last Name
Note : if using the same person for agent and creator, make sure the person has email Id (foaf:mbox)
3. This may be trivial but the nodes which describe the file in the data folder should have url as "file://root/project/data/P2016_1014_data/RRT_GlobalCycles.do" instead of "file://root/project/P2016_1014_data/RRT_GlobalCycles.do". 
4. In ICPSR we map subject terms to dcat:keyword and jelClassification to imeta:jelClassification. So in order to avoid confusion you can map subject terms (if any) at "file://root/project#keyword" and the jel classification codes at "file://root/project#jelClassification". This way we could totally avoid using the term "subject" in the metadata file. which would look something like this : 
<rdf:Description rdf:about="file://root/project">
        ....
       <dcat:keyword>file://root/project#keyword</dcat:keyword>
       <imeta:jelClassification>file://root/project#jelClassification</imeta:jelClassification>
</rdf:Description>
<rdf:Description rdf:about="file://root/project#keyword">

5. I found 1 or 2 of the projects did not have a <dcterms:description> under the <rdf:Description rdf:about="file://root/project">, this is a required field
