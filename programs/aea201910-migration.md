# Migrating historical AEA supplements - DRAFT

*Author: Lars Vilhuber, Cornell University, AEA Data Editor ([dataeditor@aeapubs.org](mailto:dataeditor@aeapubs.org))*

*Last updated: 2020-01-10*



Since July 16, 2019, the American Economic Association has used the **[AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea)** at **[openICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/)** as the default archive for its supplements. This archive serves a dual purpose: to share data with the AEA Data Editor prior to being published, and as a publication outlet for supplements to articles in AEA journals.

At the time, the AEA also announced that it would  migrate the historical supplements, hitherto stored as ZIP files on the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals), into the AEA Data and Code Repository. 

On Oct 1, 2019, openICPSR had 867 deposits, which covered 94 deposits in the [DataLumos](https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies) archive, 46 in the [AERA archive](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aerajournals/studies), and 13 in the [PSID](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/psid/studies) archive. The **AEA Data and Code Repository** contained at the time 93 deposits, of which 5 were public, the others awaiting publication of the associated article. 

Between Oct 11 and Oct 13, 2019, the staff at openICPSR ingested 2,552 historical supplements, increasing the size of the openICPSR repository **by a factor of 3**, to 3,461. This was only the first part of the migration, as there are about 1,000 more archives that need to be migrated.

## Increased findability
The migrated archives are now available through the [openICPSR search interface](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies), the [general ICPSR search interface](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/search/studies), as well as through a variety of federated search interfaces such as [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/search). For instance, the current AER Editor's supplements can be found [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies?start=0&ARCHIVE=aea&sort=score%20desc%2CTITLE_SORT%20asc&rows=25&q=esther%20duflo), [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/search/studies?start=0&ARCHIVE=ICPSR&PUBLISH_STATUS=PUBLISHED&sort=score%20desc%2CTITLE_SORT%20asc&rows=50&q=esther%20duflo) and [here](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/search?query=esther duflo), with increasing generality.

## Characteristics of AEA supplement data
We can describe this subset of the historical supplements in a variety of ways. 

### Time coverage
This is only a subset of all supplements, so what years are covered?

### Software used
To identify software usage and data formats, we (manually) [mapped file extensions](../data/original/aea_file_ext.csv)  into known software packages, and classified the file type into a set of categories:

The top software with respect to number of files is **Stata**. Note that there are 258 supplements that do not contain files that we have identified as program files ("None"). 

More interesting is how many supplements use one or more software:

![Software usage](figure_software.png)

Clearly, **Stata** is the most popular statistical software in the journals of the AEA (72.96 percent of all supplements use it), followed by **Matlab** (22.45 percent). Note again the 258 supplements that do not contain files that we have identified as program files ("None").

### Data formats 
It is somewhat more ambiguous identifying data files, as they come in a large variety of formats. Furthermore, data might be compressed. In the following table, we tabulate data files and archives, by the software package associated with their extension. The data type "General" encompasses formats like "tsv" or "csv" that are not associated with any particular software, but are nevertheless clearly identifiable as data files ([full list available](../data/original/aea_file_ext.csv)). We restrict ourselves to the number of supplements which contain files with such extensions.

## Metadata 
When planning the migration, the preservation of existing metadata - the information about the data and code - was important. The AEA Data Editor worked with the openICPSR staff to enhance the data infrastructure, adding the capability to store and display JEL codes in addition to subject terms.  Going forward, in addition to adding the JEL codes that also describe the linked article, authors can add metadata such as *geographic coverage*, *funding sources*, *time periods*, *geographic units* as well as *units of observation*, greatly enhancing the ability of researchers to find data through the openICPSR search interface. 

Two important caveats apply, however. First, none of the additional metadata exists for the historical archives. Second, the openICPSR search interface only allows to search for these in an implicit way, i.e., one can search for "J31" because it is unlikely to appear as anything else, but there is no selection by specific JEL codes currently possible. The ability to do so is planned for a later implementation.






Metadata on which supplement at openICPSR relates to which article can be found in a few ways. First, in registering the new supplement DOI at openICPSR, a relationship link pointing to the article was created. A query to the [Datacite API](https://api.datacite.org/). For instance, the article with the largest supplement had article DOI 10.1257/pandp.20181045. The associated supplement now has DOI 10.3886/E114448V1. The Datacite API query for the supplement would be [https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.3886/E114448V1](https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.3886/E114448V1), and querying this URL would yield a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) object, identifying the link:

![Partial JSON from query](../assets/datacite_api_extract.png)

Alternatively, we have created a linkage file, available at [https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-supplement-migration/blob/master/data/generated/table.aea.icpsr.mapping.csv](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-supplement-migration/blob/master/data/generated/table.aea.icpsr.mapping.csv), containing the article DOI, the title of the paper, and the supplement DOI at openICPSR:
